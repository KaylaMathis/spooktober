# Spooktober

Project for creating an entire web page, landing page. Spooktober was designed with the best season in mind. Landing page needed to have the standard header, content, call to action, and footer you would find on any modern webpage. Please note: The buttons and links are not hooked up at this time as this was not part of the scope of this project. 

### Tasks and Functional Goals
The landing page needed to fit into the given format. Pictures, colors, fonts, and text was free formed as the page layout and structure was the main goal. Setting up the HTML from scratch and then getting the CSS to style the page how needed. The main goal of this project was using CSS Flexbox to get the page layout into the correct areas.
